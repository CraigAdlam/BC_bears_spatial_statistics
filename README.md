# BC_bears_spatial_statistics

***Important to Note***

`BC_Parks.Rda` file is from last year (2023 cohort)  

- useful because it utilizes proj4string (proj args)
- window should be similar to BC_Covariates.Rda (also uses proj args)
- this way when plotting, the comparisons should be accurate (if needed)
