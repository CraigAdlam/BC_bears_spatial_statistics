# BC_bears_spatial_statistics

### Important to Note  

`BC_Parks.Rda` file is from last year (2023 cohort)  
- useful because it utilizes proj4string (proj args)
- window should be similar to BC_Covariates.Rda (also uses proj args)
- this way when plotting, the comparisons should be accurate (if needed)

`occurrence.txt` file contains the information necessary for analysis  
- this contains all the occurrences for the american black bear (***Ursus-americanus-pallas***)
